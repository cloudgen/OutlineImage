# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to **VideoJoin** are documented here.  
Version SSOT: `pyproject.toml` + `src/VideoJoin/__init__.__version__`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- (none yet)

### Changed

- (none yet)

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Same-FS staging helpers (`staging_dir_for`, `make_temp_path`) and **`promote_file` → `shutil.move`** for publishing intermediates.
- Unique temp concat list and media intermediates (no fixed cwd-only `filelist.txt` strategy).
- Product requirements set (class, domain, pipeline, CLI, coding-style, packaging, structure, errors, runtime).
- Promote gate checklist **`CL-PYTHON-SHUTIL-MOVE-PUBLISH`** (blank + filled run).

### Changed

- Join pipeline: stream-copy to temp → promote; on failure re-encode to temp → promote.
- Package public surface: `__version__` and `main` only (no phantom `ChronicleLogger` re-export from `.cli`).
- Product README rewritten for install/usage honesty (local package primary; FFmpeg system dep).

### Fixed

- Fail-closed re-encode path: non-zero FFmpeg or missing intermediate no longer prints success.
- Reject final output path equal to either source path.

### Security

- Still user-level only; no Type 1 elevation. FFmpeg invoked with argument lists (no shell string interpolation of free-form filters).

---

## [1.0.2] - prior

### Added

- Interactive two-file join with FFmpeg stream-copy and re-encode fallback.
- Package layout under `src/VideoJoin/` with console script `video-join`.

### Notes

- Earlier packaging claims may have listed broad Python support and optional Cython tooling; runtime join does not require Cython.

Update this file when shipping version bumps; keep body complete (no hollow TBD sections for claimed releases).
